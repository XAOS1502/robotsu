# robotsu
A personal discord bot coded in python

## https://xaos1502.github.io/robotsu/

If you install this bot, remove the cogs, because I haven't uploaded them yet, and the bot will not work if any cog is missing. Don't worry about the logs/restart.txt file, it should be created authomatically. If it isn't, then create the folder in the same directory of botsu.py

If you don't know what I am talking about, then leave this alone, google some tutorials on youtube to learn the basic concepts and bot structure, then come back.

And remember:
            Robotsu doesn't make fun or bully those who want to learn,
                        be like Robotsu
