            <p><b>Discord</b> is an all-in-one voice and text chat originally created <abbr title="to hang out in hundreds of online communities,">for gamers,</abbr>but now used by all since it's free, secure, and works on any desktop (using their dedicated <abbr title="compatible with Linux, Mac, and Windows">client</abbr>), or <abbr title="Firefox, Chrome, Opera, Safary, Chrome">web browser</abbr>, as well as on your <abbr title="Android or iOS">smartphone</abbr>, meaning the fun can continue even while you are on-the-go, or off on vacation.</p>
            <p>Imagine all the advantages and benefits of WhatsApp™, TeamSpeak™, Skype™, plus the control of the good 'ol message boards.</p>
            <p>Well, now you can stop imagining and start enjoying them in a single app!</p>
            <p>You don't have to share your private number or email to connect with people as some apps, like WhatsApp, force you to. And you can stop paying for TeamSpeak servers to keep in touch with friends. No more hassling with Skype either, or having to hunt for any sketchy ways to communicate and share with friends, or your new chosen family. Simplify your life and Join the Revolution!</p>

            <h3 class="ligatures">THE BOT HUNT <em>IS</em> OVER</h3>
            
            <p><b>Robotsu</b> is a friendly bot designed to keep you company and help you manage your Discord Guild. He comes with many fun and interactive commands to assist you with expressing what can't be said by <em>words alone</em>.</p>
            
            <p>Use <abbr title="`Robotsu feedback`">feedback command</abbr> to let his Devs know what other features interest you, or simply to send a bit of encouragement and love. <b>(˵¯͒⌄¯͒˵)</b></p>
            
            <p> primary focus of <b>Robotsu</b>'s Dev was to do away with the overused GIF and PNG images most bots on Discord tend to rely on, and instead to focus on cute <em>Kaomoji</em> emotes.</p>
            
            <p><abbr title="(∩ ˘-˘)⊃━☆ﾟ.*･｡ﾟ"><b><u>Kaomoji sample:</u></b></abbr></p>
            
            <p>Most of <b>Robotsu</b>'s commands are presented in neat Embeds, with very minimal use of images, so as not to steal attention away from the conversation, but instead to enhance it without interrupting the flow. To see a list of the available commands simply type the <abbr title="`Robotsu commands`">help command</abbr> in a text channel of private message.</p>

            <p><abbr title="@mention | Robotsu <command> [input]"><b><u><b>Robotsu</b>'s prefix:</u></b></abbr></p>
            
            <p>At the moment <b>Robotsu</b>'s Devs aren't taking donations, which means he's <abbr title="as in 'free beer' or 'free hugs'">Free</abbr> to invite him into your Discord guild... So hurry up!</p>
            
            <p>Soon he will also include <abbr title="Salad Radio™">a <b><u>new surprise</u></b></abbr> that's currently in development. Watch this space for updates!</p>
            
            <p>Sincere thanks from <b>Robotsu's dan boru-bako</b> <em>support server and developers</em> for your interest in our friendly, PG-13, pet-robot. Take him out of his box and see what he can do for you!</p>
